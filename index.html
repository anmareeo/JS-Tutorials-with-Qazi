<!-- JSON - It is used to represent data. It stands for Javascript Object Notation. Generally it is used for APIs to carry information that is very very lightweight, so APIs and configurations. Below between the script tags, you would call this an array with objects inside of it. In Python you would call it a list with objects inside of it.-->


<!-- the text below is JSON, but it is fully functional JavaScript -->
<!--  
<script>
    let students = [
    {
        "first": "Anmaree",
        "last": "Osmond",
        "age": 45
    },
    {
        "first": "Ree",
        "last": "Jensen",
        "age": 46
    }
]
console.log(students)
// what shows up in the console is this: (2) [{…}, {…}]


</script>
-->
 <!-- A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server. When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.  -->

<!-- To represent like an actual array when we get this, we just turn it into a string, by wrapping it in back-ticks as shown below: -->

<script>
    let students = `[
    {
        "first": "Anmaree",
        "last": "Osmond",
        "age": 45
    },
    {
        "first": "Ree",
        "last": "Jensen",
        "age": 46
    }
]`
// the above is what a JSON object looks like. all you have to do to deal with it is JSON.parse and then give it the file you want it to parse
console.log(JSON.parse(students)[1].age)
</script>
<!-- The above shows 46, which is the age of the second person, but I can change it to get whatever piece of info i need from the array of students -->
